# movie-app
Final project for mobile app development which we had 2 weeks to complete.  The app consists of a set of movies which displays information
about the movie. a poster of the movie, a DB which provides showtimes of the movies, a camera app to take a picture while at the movie, 
and a movie quiz which provides a list of questions over the movies offered and counts the users score.
